# Web-Scraping-Job-Postings

This project taught me how can scraping can be useful when you need to make your own analysis with only a few questions if you haven't got the data. Using Scraping I learned to collect data on data jobs from Indeed.com. I cleaned the data and did the EDA and went on to predict below points.

1. Determine the industry factors that are most important in predicting the salary amounts for these data.

2. Determine the factors that distinguish job categories and titles from each other. For example, can required skills accurately predict job title?
